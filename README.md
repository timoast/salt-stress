# Salt stress ATAC-seq

Salt stress was performed in duplicate on Arabidopsis plants
expressing the INTACT construct for isolation of different cell
types. Mannitol was used as a control for changes in osmotic pressure
during salt stress. ATAC-seq was performed on root cell types from
stressed or control plants.
